# Fork on The Range
An experiment to see what it will take for people to fork a repo, by rewriting a line from an old song. See what's up at http://cogdog.github.io/fork-on-the-Range

Better yet, [go to the repo[(https://github.com/cogdog/fork-on-the-range/tree/gh-pages) and fork [index.html](https://github.com/cogdog/fork-on-the-range/blob/gh-pages/index.html) to edit part of the song. 

What are you waiting for?
