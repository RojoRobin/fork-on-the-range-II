# Fork on The Range
*launched by Alan Levine @cogdog*

![forking the range](images/ranch.jpg  "home on the range")

An experiment to see what it will take for people to fork a repo, by rewriting a line from the old (and thus public domain) [Home On the Range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_on_the_Range) the version by Dr. Brewster Higley (1876). 

Better yet, [go to the repo](https://github.com/cogdog/fork-on-the-range/tree/gh-pages) and fork [index.html](https://github.com/cogdog/fork-on-the-range/blob/gh-pages/fork-this.md) to edit this very file. It's in Markdown, which you do not need to know, just edit any part of the lyrics below. It's more fun to edit just a few lines, but hey, the only person stopping you is you.

Notice that the pattern is:

    (1) Intro line that ends in a rhymmable word
    (2) Second Like that builds and ends in another rhyme
    (3) Third coupler HERE that rhymes again DEAR
    (4) Bring together ends by rhyming line 2 in time

## Fork on the Range (a new GitHub Classic)

Oh, fork me a repo where the edits go
Where the Brave and the Fearless play;
Where seldom is fomented a negative comment,
And the remixes happen all day.

#### Chorus
A repo! A repo!
Where the Brave and the Fearless play;
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word,
And the sky is not cloudy all day.

Oh! give me a land where the bright diamond sand
Throws its light from the glittering streams,
Where glideth along the graceful white swan,
Like the maid in her heavenly dreams.

** Chorus **

Oh! give me a gale of the Solomon vale,
Where the life streams with buoyancy flow;
On the banks of the Beaver, where seldom if ever,
Any poisonous herbage doth grow.

** Chorus **

How often at night, when the heavens were bright,
With the light of the twinkling stars
Have I stood here amazed, and asked as I gazed,
If their glory exceed that of ours.

** Chorus **

I love the wild flowers in this bright land of ours,
I love the wild curlew's shrill scream;
The bluffs and white rocks, and antelope flocks
That graze on the mountains so green.

** Chorus **

The air is so pure and the breezes so fine,
The zephyrs so balmy and light,
That I would not exchange my home here to range
Forever in azures so bright.

** Chorus **
